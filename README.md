# Vizualizing the Demand for Transport Systems in Chicago

In this repository, we explore the changing demand patterns for transportation in Chicago by assessing the impacts of external factors, such as seasonality (with Chicago's extreme winters), sports games (Chicago Cubs/Bears & White Sox), concerts (Lolapalooza), New Year's, and other interesting variables. 

We also wish to assess if these factors induce users to switch between different forms of public transport (Trains, Buses), as well as away from public transport and towards other forms of transport, such as taxis or bikes (Divvy Bikes).
